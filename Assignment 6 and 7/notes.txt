Just a few notes on the submitted homework:

To run properly, the files must be included within the same directory as the code.

To compile, run 'make' and then run ./signal_analysis.

For clarity: the highest_value.cc source code includes both the function for generating the N highest values of the results and the print function. 
The power_spectrum_cc.cc source code contains both the function that calculates the power spectrum and the correlation coefficient. 

Last notes:
filename.cc - generates the file name to be used as a string for reading in data.
file_reader.cc - reads the data based on a string.
fftw.cc - computes the FFTW (FT) of the signal data.

Et voila! Enjoy. I am really enjoying learning how to code in C++, especially when it deals with gravitational waves!

*This was not tested on SciNet due to the size of the data files!*
